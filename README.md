# Introduction
This project was created under the guidance of Luke Barousse's course on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUSDVGivd-8) to discover insights of data analyst roles in Australia. The dataset used was from Luke's [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukebarousse/data_jobs).
Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:
1. What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
4. What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying)  

# Tools Used
üêç Python: The backbone of this project, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.I also used the following Python libraries:  
   - Pandas Library: This was used to analyze the data.
   - Matplotlib Library: This was used to visualized the data.
   - Seaborn Library: This was used to create more advanced visuals.  

üìì Jupyter Notebooks: The tool I used to run my Python scripts which enables me to include my notes and analysis.  

üíª Visual Studio Code: A lightweight, versatile code editor. I utilized     Visual Studio Code to edit project scripts and manage images, ensuring seamless integration and synchronization with GitHub for version control and collaboration.  

üêô Git & Github: My go-to for version control and tracking my project progress.

# ETL
Extraced data from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukebarousse/data_jobs), performed initial data cleaning to ensure accuracy and usability.

**Import and Clean Data**

```python
# importing libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# load data
dataset= load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df=dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# data cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

**Filter Australia Jobs**
This project focuses on postings from the Australia market. So I applied filters to the dataset and narrowed down the roles to Australia only.
```python
df_US = df[df['job_country'] == 'Australia']
```
# The Analysis

Each Jupyter Notebook in this project focused on exploring distinct aspects of the data job market. Here's the approach I used for each analysis:  

## :one: What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To identify the most in-demand skills for the top three most popular data roles, I filtered the data to isolate these roles and extracted the top five skills associated with each. This analysis highlights the most sought-after job titles and their key skill requirements, providing valuable insights into the skills to prioritize based on my target role.

**Visualize Data**

```python
# plotting 3 rows 1 column
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    # find jobs that are on the job_titles list
    df_plot = df_skills_percent[df_skills_percent['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    # plot chart using seaborn
    sns.barplot(
        data=df_plot,
        x='skill_percent',
        y='job_skills',
        ax=ax[i],
        hue='skill_count',
        palette='dark:b_r'
    )
    ax[i].set_title(job_title)
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].get_legend().remove()
    ax[i].set_xlim(0,78)
    # add labels to each bar by looping through df_plot
    for index, value in enumerate(df_plot['skill_percent']):
        ax[i].text(value +1 , index, f'{value:.0f}%', va='center') 
        # value +1 so its a bit far away from the bar
        # va='center' to position labels in the center
        # f'{value:.0f}%' converts the numbers to a float with no decimal places
    # remove xaxis and only keeping the bottom one
    if i != len(job_titles) -1:
        ax[i].set_xticks([])      
fig.suptitle('Likelihood of Skills Requested in Australia Job Postings', fontsize=15)
fig.tight_layout(h_pad=0.5) # fix overlap
plt.show()
```
**Results**

**Visualize Data**

```python
# Plot
df_plot = df_DA_aus_percent.iloc[:, :5]
# create the lineplot and store the axes object
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.lineplot(
    data=df_plot,
    dashes=False,
    palette='tab10'
)
sns.despine()
plt.title('Trending Top Skills for Data Analysts in Australia')
plt.ylabel('Likelihood in Job Posting')
plt.xlabel('2023')
# add legend with matching colors
handles, labels = ax.get_legend_handles_labels()  # extract the line handles and labels
plt.legend(
    title="Skills",
    handles=handles,  # ensure legend uses the line colors
    labels=df_plot.columns.tolist(),  # use column names for labels
    loc="upper left",  # position legend at the upper left
    bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1),  # move legend outside the plot
    fontsize=10
)
# change y-axis to percentage
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter
ax = plt.gca()
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```  

**Results**

- Lower demand for Tableau may indicate it‚Äôs a **nice-to-have** skill or used in more specific contexts compared to Power BI.

## :three:.:one: How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?  

To determine the highest-paying roles and skills, I focused on job postings in Australia and analyzed their median salaries. I began by examining the salary distributions for common data roles, such as Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to identify which positions offer the highest compensation.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb](/2_Project/4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb)

**Visualize Data**

```python
# plot with seaborn, sort by salary median
sns.boxplot(data=df_aus_top10, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
plt.title('Salary Distribution in the Australia')
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary ($USD)')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.xlim(0,600000)
ticks_x=plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()
```

**Results**

*Box plot visualizing the salary distributions for the top 10 data job titles.*

**Insights**
- **Senior Data Scientist and Senior Data Engineer** are the most lucrative positions, reflecting the demand for experienced professionals in these fields.
- The wide salary range suggests **opportunities for both entry-level and highly experienced professionals**, depending on specialization and industry.
- **Cloud Engineers** have a competitive median salary, suggesting growing demand in cloud infrastructure roles.
- **Data Analysts and Business Analysts are compensated at lower ranges**, aligning with their position as foundational roles in data and business operations.

## :three:.:two: Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts?
I then refined my analysis to focus exclusively on data analyst roles, examining both the highest-paid skills and the most in-demand skills. To present these insights, I utilized two bar charts for clear visualization.  

**Visualize Data**  

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2,1)
#set seaborn theme
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
# plot df_DA_top_pay
# use seaborn.barplot
sns.barplot(
    data=df_DA_top_pay,
    x='median',
    y=df_DA_top_pay.index,
    ax=ax[0],
    hue ='median',
    palette='dark:b_r') # '_r' to reverse colroing
ax[0].legend().remove() # remove legend
ax[0].set_title('Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts')
ax[0].set_ylabel('')
ax[0].set_xlabel('')
ax[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x,_: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))
# plot df_DA_skills
# use seaborn.barplot
sns.barplot(
    data=df_DA_skills,
    x='median',
    y=df_DA_skills.index,
    ax=ax[1],
    hue ='median',
    palette='light:b'
)
ax[1].legend().remove() # remove legend
ax[1].set_title('Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts')
ax[1].set_ylabel('')
ax[1].set_xlabel('Median Salary ($USD)')
ax[1].set_xlim(ax[0].get_xlim())
ax[1].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x,_: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

**Results**

![top_paid_and_top_demand_skills](/2_Project/images/top_paid_skills.png)  
*Two separate bar graphs visualizing the highest paid skills and most in-demand skills for data analysts in Australia.*  

**Insights**
- **Tableau** commands the highest salaries but is less frequently requested, indicating it may be a specialized skill valued by select employers.

df_DA_skills_high_demand.plot(kind='scatter',x='skill_percent',y='median_salary')
# empty list to collect x and y values and label names in the for loop below
texts = []
# create a loop to find skill location (x,y)
for i, txt in enumerate(df_DA_skills_high_demand.index):   texts.append(plt.text(df_DA_skills_high_demand['skill_percent'].iloc[i],df_DA_skills_high_demand['median_salary'].iloc[i],txt))
adjust_text(texts, arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='gray', lw=1))
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter
ax = plt.gca()
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K'))
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))
# set axis labels, title and legend
plt.xlabel('Percent of Data Analyst Job Postings')
plt.ylabel('Median Yearly Salary ($USD)')
plt.title('Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in Australia')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
